# Network Protocols ‚Äì Research & Documentation

This repository contains well-structured R&D documents that explain the architecture, working, and functionality of various foundational networking models and protocols. These documents are part of a networking study and help simplify core concepts for academic or personal learning.

## üìÑ Documents Included

1. **OSI Model Working**  
   A detailed breakdown of all 7 layers of the OSI model, their responsibilities, flow of data, and real-world examples.

2. **TCP/IP Model Overview**  
   Explanation of the 4-layer TCP/IP model, including how it maps to the OSI model, its practical usage in networks, and protocol examples.

3. **TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP Protocols**  
   Functional comparison between TCP and UDP; Working principles of HTTP, HTTPS, and ICMP including how each protocol operates within a network.

## üß† Purpose
These documents are created to support networking fundamentals for students and tech learners, especially those studying OSI & TCP/IP models and internet protocols.
